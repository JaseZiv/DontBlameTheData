      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>This is a test website created by Jason Zivkovic.
Growing up as a sports-mad child and teen, statistics were always in my world. But with the love of sport blinding me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even realise it was a love of statistics and data. Then, after meandering (much to my moter&amp;rsquo;s chagrin) through my early work life, and dabbling with things, I discovered edX and the data analysis short courses they had available.</description>

      <title>Building an Linear Regression Model in R to Predict AFL Crowds</title>

      <description>Introduction There is a lot of talk about crowd behaviour and crowd issues with the modern day AFL. I personally feel the crowd issues are a case of business-as-usual; I’ve been going to AFL games on-and-off for close to three decades and the crowd behaviour is no different today as it was 20 years ago… just now everyone with a phone and Twitter account is a journo.
Anyway, that’s my two cents worth.</description>

      <title>Using Data To Determine Which AFL Fans Jump On The Bandwagon</title>
      <link>/post/afl_bandwagon_analysis/</link>

      <description>Introduction This post is the first in a two-part series on AFL crowds. This analysis will be a thorough look at AFL crowd numbers over the last 20 years, and will aim to discover which team’s fans are the biggest bandwagon jumpers. Bandwagon Jumpers are those fans that are the loudest in the office or in your friendship group when things are going well, and the quietest when their team is losing.</description>
