      <description>Introduction There is a lot of talk about crowd behaviour and crowd issues with the modern day AFL. I personally feel the crowd issues are a case of business-as-usual; I’ve been going to AFL games on-and-off for close to three decades and the crowd behaviour is no different today as it was 20 years ago… just now everyone with a phone and Twitter account is a journo.
Anyway, that’s my two cents worth.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is the first in a two-part series on AFL crowds. This analysis will be a thorough look at AFL crowd numbers over the last 20 years, and will aim to discover which team’s fans are the biggest bandwagon jumpers. Bandwagon Jumpers are those fans that are the loudest in the office or in your friendship group when things are going well, and the quietest when their team is losing.</description>

      <description>My name is Jason Zivkovic and I&amp;rsquo;m a Data Scientist at the Reece Group.
Growing up as a sports-mad child and teen, statistics were always in my world. But with the love of sport blinding me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even realise it was a love of statistics and data.

      <description>Introduction The Australian 2019 Federal Election is almost upon us (18th of May) and as usual, I have no idea who to vote for. Well that’s not true, usually, I’m what is colloquially described as a “donkey voter” - someone who doesn’t vote. You see, in democratic Australia, it is compulsory to vote. From the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC):
 Failure to vote at a federal election without a valid and sufficient reason is an offence under section 245 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.</description>
