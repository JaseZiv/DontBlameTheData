      <description>After seeing my beloved Hawthorn Hawks tweet out an article on their website regarding player ages for each team, it got me riled up that the media love to cite Champion Data’s “average age” as their measure.
As can be seen with the age distribution of players as at the start of the 2020 AFL Premiership Season, the figure is going to be skewed by the older players on lists, especially with guys like Shaun Burgoyne, Kade Simpson, Gary Ablett Junior…</description>

      <description>On the 24th of August, 2019, the Australian Men’s Basketball team, the Boomers, created history when they were able to enact their own David and Golliath moment, taking down Team USA for the first time ever. More impressively was the fact that the US hadn’t lost a game in 13 years. It was a marvelous moment in Australian basketball history, and while the US fielded what is widely considered one of their weaker teams, it was a moment for us to all savour.</description>

      <description>Jarryd Roughead - four-time Hawthorn premiership player and all round great man - formally announced his retirement this week, with his last game coming over the weekend against the Gold Coast Suns.
Not only was he a pivotal four-time premiership star for the Hawthorn Hawks, he survived a hell of a lot of adversity with some very serious cancer scares and handled himself with nothing but grace and dignity.</description>

      <description>Introduction There is a lot of talk about crowd behaviour and crowd issues with the modern day AFL. I personally feel the crowd issues are a case of business-as-usual; I’ve been going to AFL games on-and-off for close to three decades and the crowd behaviour is no different today as it was 20 years ago… just now everyone with a phone and Twitter account is a journo.
Anyway, that’s my two cents worth.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is the first in a two-part series on AFL crowds. This analysis will be a thorough look at AFL crowd numbers over the last 20 years, and will aim to discover which team’s fans are the biggest bandwagon jumpers. Bandwagon Jumpers are those fans that are the loudest in the office or in your friendship group when things are going well, and the quietest when their team is losing.</description>
