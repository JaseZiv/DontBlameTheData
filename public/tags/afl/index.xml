&lt;script src=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/kePrint/kePrint.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the second installment at my look at the age distributions of each AFL team for the 2020 season. The fist post (which can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dontblamethedata.com/blog/analysing-afl-team-age/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), looked at the impact that the statistic chosen to report out the age profiles can have, specifically using the mean versus the median. Rightly so, many pointed out in feedback that some of the younger players on lists may not play as much or might not be as important as some of the older talent and as such, their age shouldn’t be given as much weighting as some of the stars of each team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That feedback led to this post, which will look at identifying each team’s top line talent and comparing the talent age distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, club Best and Fairest (B&amp;amp;F) results have been analysed to identify the top players at each club. Top 10 B&amp;amp;F data comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-best-and-fairest-winners-2019-club-champion-awards-dates-votes-leaderboards-who-won-each-clubs-best-and-fairest/news-story/a6f87d3cadd61c24aff1ba760da5549c&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There are 181 players in total (Richmond have 11 players because of a tie for 10th spot). Given there has been some player movement in the offseason (six players in the list analysed, most notably Tim Kelly to West Coast finished in their team’s top 10 and then changed clubs), these players have now been placed in their new team’s distribution. Doing this has resulted in some teams having more than 10 players analysed, while others less. See below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-age-of-top-talent&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Age of Top Talent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the age of top players at each club to measure the age profile of the club shows us that Geelong’s list is the oldest at the top end, with an average age of 29.2 years. These results highlight a concern for Kangaroos fans, as their club’s top 10 B&amp;amp;F comes in at second on this list at 28.9 years and they missed the finals last year (by a bit too, two games out and in 12th position). Adelaide fans also won’t be too happy given their results last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less concerning for GWS, Essendon and the Bulldogs (who each made finals last year), their top players are in the bottom half of this age analysis. Could be some happy times ahead for these clubs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melbourne has the youngest list, with an average age of 24.7 years, while St Kilda may see this number rise at the start of the 2021 season after they made a decent push in free agency at the end of the 2019 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/age_of_best_players_files/figure-html/oldest_teams-1.png&#34; width=&#34;768&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also see that there is a negative relationship between the top players age distribution and ladder position at the end of a season - the younger the average age of your teams top 10 B&amp;amp;F, the lower the ladder poisition tended to be (with some exceptions of course as mentioned above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/age_of_best_players_files/figure-html/relationship-1.png&#34; width=&#34;768&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to see the impact of this for more than just the most recent season. Might be one for someone else to pick up where I’ve left off, or for a later post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Analysing AFL Team Age... Properly!</title>
      <link>/blog/analysing-afl-team-age/</link>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;After seeing my beloved Hawthorn Hawks tweet out an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2019-12-04/hawks-no-longer-the-oldest-list&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on their website regarding player ages for each team, it got me riled up that the media love to cite Champion Data’s “average age” as their measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As can be seen with the age distribution of players as at the start of the 2020 AFL Premiership Season, the figure is going to be skewed by the older players on lists, especially with guys like Shaun Burgoyne, Kade Simpson, Gary Ablett Junior…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/analysing_afl_team_age_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;864&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;mean-medianwhat-of-it&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mean, Median…what of it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a data set, the arithmetic mean, also called the mathematical expectation or average, is the central value of a discrete set of numbers: specifically, the sum of the values divided by the number of values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;median&lt;/em&gt;, also &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample (a population or a probability distribution). For a data set, it may be thought of as the “middle” value. For example, in the data set {1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}, the median is 6, the fourth largest, and also the fourth smallest, number in the sample. For a continuous probability distribution, the median is the value such that a number is equally likely to fall above or below it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When data is not normally distributed around the mean (as is the case here), using it to describe the measure of centre is misleading. In cases like this, the median provides a more representative statistic. With a positively skewed distribution like the one above, statistics 101 tells us that the median will be less than the average, while the opposite would hold true where the distribution was negatively skewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average age of all players on team lists for the 2020 AFL premiership season is 24.17 years, while the median age is 23.6 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;so-why-do-they-still-report-averages&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So why do they still report averages?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect media outlets report the &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; age for two reasons;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who can be bothered explaining the nuances between the mean and the median; or more likely,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average is more prone to pull this number higher for some teams, fuelling the narrative they want to run with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;implications-of-the-different-measures&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implications of the different measures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we plot both the average and median ages of each of the teams, we can see that we get some very different outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are led to believe that the Geelong Cats have the fourth oldest list but when using the median as the statistic, they are the 11th oldest playing list, with the Kangaroos, GWS, Saints, Demons, Bombers, Bulldogs and Tigers all having older lists than them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the other implications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Brisbane Lions have the youngest list for the 2020 season, not the Gold Coast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hawks are actually the fourth oldest list, with North Melbourne being third&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Demons are the the 7th oldest list, not the 12th oldest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Power are the equal third (with the Swans) youngest list, not the 10th oldest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/analysing_afl_team_age_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1056&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;why-does-any-of-this-matter&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How this figure is reported probably doesn’t matter ultimately; the age of a playing list likely isn’t all that important when it comes to the ultimate glory of premiership success, as can be seen in the different age distributions of recent premiership teams in this great little analysis at &lt;a href=&#34;https://thearcfooty.com/2016/04/24/how-old-is-the-typical-premiership-team/&#34;&gt;TheArc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That aside, it would be nice to see this figure reported a little more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rant. Over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data for this post and the code used to scrape it can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JaseZiv/Dont-Blame-the-Data-Data-Files/tree/master/analysing_afl_team_age&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post aims to introduce you to animating ggplot2 visualisations in r using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate&#34;&gt;gganimate&lt;/a&gt; package by Thomas Lin Pedersen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post will visualise the theoretical winnings I would’ve had, had I followed the simple model to predict (or tip as it’s known in Australia) winners in the AFL that I explained in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dontblamethedata.com/blog/simplifying-afl-tipping/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. The data used in the analysis was collected from the AFL Tables website as part of a larger series I wrote about on AFL crowds. The wider project can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JaseZiv/AFL-Crowd-Analytics&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;lets-start&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let’s start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so the first step I took when writing the original post was to create a ggplot2 visual to plot the winnings (or losses) I would’ve made using my simple strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;total_money %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x= round, y= cumulating_winnings, 
             group = season, colour = as.character(season))) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 2, colour = &amp;quot;black&amp;quot;) +
  labs(x= &amp;quot;Round&amp;quot;, y= &amp;quot;Cumulative Wins/Losses&amp;quot;, colour = &amp;quot;Season&amp;quot;) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 27), 
                     labels = c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24), 
                     breaks = c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = colours) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;2017 WOULD&amp;#39;VE BEEN A BAD YEAR&amp;quot;) +
  theme(legend.position = &amp;quot;bottom&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/gganimate_animation_guide_files/figure-html/static_line1-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1056&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad, but certainly could be improved. To my mind, with six seasons being plotted, the legend is hard to map to the line itself. Also, other than the 2017 season, which was particularly bad, the other seasons’ variation between rounds was hard to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, plotting the data this way made it hard to realise without expending far too much energy focusing on where I would’ve made money, and where I would’ve lost it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;labels-and-annotations&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Labels and Annotations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuck - you can’t just simply add the season as a label - you can’t read anything!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;total_money %&amp;gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x= round, y= cumulating_winnings, 
             group = season, colour = as.character(season))) +

&lt;p&gt;Instead, only one season label was applied, and applied at the end of each line’s run. This looks much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we can see, further elements were added to our static chart, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding the break-even line;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formatting the y-axis to a dollar format; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding labels and removing the legend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has greatly improved the readability of the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;hello-animations&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hello Animations!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the above chart looks a lot better, there are no theatrics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter animations from gganimate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an animated plot allows us to remove even more elements. With the right mix of labelling and animation, the y-axis no longer is necessary - with each round, we can follow the winnings or losses as we go, while the break-even line gives us a reference point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other things that were done here include the slowing down of frames using &lt;code&gt;fps&lt;/code&gt; (frames per second) and adjusting the &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;transition_reveal()&lt;/code&gt; to be longer than the rounds it’s transitioning over (ie adjusting the range to &lt;code&gt;c(0,25)&lt;/code&gt;). This allows the animation to pause after it has finished its cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, to increase the size of the output, adjust the &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; arguments to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;total_money_anim &amp;lt;-  total_money %&amp;gt;%

        axis.title.y = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(), 
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()) +
  transition_reveal(round, range = c(0, 25))


animate(total_money_anim, width = 900, height = 900, fps = 5)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/gganimate_animation_guide_files/figure-html/animation_plot-1.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this has given you some inspiration to go out and start producing some animated visualisations of your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know in the comments if you have any questions or suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effectively Simplifying AFL Tipping</title>
      <link>/blog/simplifying-afl-tipping/</link>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;I feel like I always overthink footy tipping. During each round, I make myself believe I have some sort of secret sauce and conjure up visions in my head of nailing a solid roughy… and then fall flat half way through the season and give up…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then I thought, surely there’s an easier way. Only problem was, I thought this up last weekend (during the last season of the round)…I wonder how many tips I would’ve gotten this year had I just picked the home team every game…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/afl_tipping_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1056&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so 113 winners wouldn’t have been good enough…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;using-the-market&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Using the Market&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I thought, what if I just picked the favourites in the betting market for each game, but with a twist? If the line was less than half a goal (3 points - virtually a coin flip), then I’d just go safe and pick the home team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The betting odds data comes from the Australian Sports Betting website which uses Bet365 odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/afl_tipping_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1056&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I would’ve been able to (theoretically) get my tips up to 135 for the 2019 season - a really handy result, and beating some popular machine learning models that are out there! This 135 correct tips also doesn’t count draws being awarded as a point, as some tipping competitions do (although there were no draws in 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than 2017, this model - I’ll refer to it as &lt;em&gt;“Simple Model”&lt;/em&gt; - would’ve been fairly competitive in each season since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe next year, I’ll know what I’ll employ… my &lt;em&gt;Simple Model&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;but-can-we-make-some-money&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But can we make some money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so now that I know that the &lt;em&gt;Simple Model&lt;/em&gt;’* performs fairly competitively in tipping comps, I want to know if I can make some money using this method?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, I’m placing a theoretic $10 on each game and seeing how many bags of cash are left at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/afl_tipping_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1056&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm… so using this method, I would’ve lost almost $40, even though it was good enough to win some tipping comps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in 2018 would this method have worked, with a net profit of $26.82…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2017 season would’ve been the most brutal, losing just over $245 for the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out where everything went so wrong, we can use an animated line plot that tracks the overall profit throughout each round of the season. To get a rundown on how the animated plot was generated, see this post &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dontblamethedata.com/blog/all-roads-lead-to-gganimate/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/afl_tipping_files/figure-html/animation_plot-1.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 2019 season, we can see that things would’ve started off really bleak - after round five, I would’ve been down over $120! Things started to pick up from there though, even being in the black at round 14. At no point during the 2015 and 2017 seasons would this model have been profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While keeping me competitive in footy tipping comps, this model certainly isn’t going to allow me to retire anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>A tribute to Jarryd Roughead with some obscure data</title>
      <link>/blog/a-tribute-to-jarryd-roughead-using-data-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
&lt;script src=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/kePrint/kePrint.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Jarryd Roughead - four-time Hawthorn premiership player and all round great man - formally announced his retirement this week, with his last game coming over the weekend against the Gold Coast Suns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was he a pivotal four-time premiership star for the Hawthorn Hawks, he survived a hell of a lot of adversity with some very serious cancer scares and handled himself with nothing but grace and dignity. He came back to captain his club in 2017 and while the on-field element was tough to come back to, he was lumped with the burden of captaining the club after they parted ways with stalwarts Sam Mitchell and Jordan Lewis after the 2016 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He filled key posts down back during the early part of his career, then moved up forward where he played a very, very good second option, then also carved out a valuable ruck/midfielder role for the club a bit later on. He could play everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved him as a footballer, but the man he seems to be makes me envious I don’t know him personally. I wanted to take an in depth (but different) look at the career he had with the mighty Hawks using some frequently used data visualisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the articles written about this great man will focus on the more well known numbers of his career… the 282 (to be 283 after his last game), the 572 goals, the four flags, Coleman Medal in 2013 and All Australian selections in 2013-14. Rightfully so too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post however is going to look at some of the more obscure aspects of Roughy’s playing time so we have a full view of his time in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data for this post originally comes from AFL Tables, but through Jimmy Day’s amazing &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jimmyday12/fitzRoy&#34;&gt;fitzRoy&lt;/a&gt; R package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(fitzRoy)
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

theme_set(theme_minimal())

stats_players &amp;lt;- get_afltables_stats(start_date = &amp;quot;2000-01-01&amp;quot;, end_date = &amp;quot;2019-10-01&amp;quot;)

rough &amp;lt;- stats_players %&amp;gt;% 
  filter(str_detect(First.name, &amp;quot;Jarryd&amp;quot;),
         str_detect(Surname, &amp;quot;Roughead&amp;quot;))


rough &amp;lt;- rough %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(final = ifelse(str_detect(Round, &amp;quot;F&amp;quot;), &amp;quot;Y&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;N&amp;quot;),
         Opponent = ifelse(Home.team == Playing.for, Away.team, Home.team))


rough &amp;lt;- rough %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(Date = ymd(Date),
         Weekday = wday(Date, label = T),
         StartingHour = substr(Local.start.time, 1,2 ),
         TimePeriod = ifelse(as.numeric(StartingHour) &amp;lt; 17, &amp;quot;Afternoon&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Evening&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;when-were-roughys-games-played&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;When were Roughy’s games played?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of Roughy’s 282 games, not one of them was played on a Wednesday - understandable given the Hawks don’t have any ANZAC Day games and no other holiday falls on a Wednesday. Every other day of the week he played. Saturdays are where he played most of his games, with 47% of his games played then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tribute_to_roughy_files/figure-html/weekdays-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1056&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most frequent starting time of games Roughy played was in the 20th hour of the day (start time between 7pm and 8pm), followed by games starting between 2pm to 3pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tribute_to_roughy_files/figure-html/startTime-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1056&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;where-were-roughs-games-played&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Where were Rough’s games played?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No surprises to see that Roughy played most of his games at either the ’G or in Tasmania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the only interstate finals Rough ever played in were at Subiaco (in Western Australia), where he played three (two of those came in the same finals series - the 2015 season, where the Hawks won their third premiership in a row).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tribute_to_roughy_files/figure-html/venues-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1056&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What conditions did the great man play in?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this section, I will use the weather data from my series on AFL crowds and the data and code for collecting the data can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JaseZiv/AFL-Crowd-Analytics&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# read in data
rain_data &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JaseZiv/AFL-Crowd-Analytics/master/data/cleaned_data/afl_preprocessed.csv&amp;quot;, stringsAsFactors = F)

# select just the required variables, first creating a key to join back to the &amp;#39;rough&amp;#39; df
rain_data &amp;lt;- rain_data %&amp;gt;% 
  select(team1, team2, date, rainfall_clean, min_temp, max_temp) %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(gameId = paste(team1, team2, date, sep = &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;% 
  select(-team1, -team2, -date)

# join data back
rough &amp;lt;- rough %&amp;gt;% 
  mutate(gameId = paste(Home.team, Away.team, Date, sep = &amp;quot;-&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;% 
  left_join(rain_data, by = &amp;quot;gameId&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  select(-gameId)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wettest game Roughy played in was a 2012 loss against Richmond at the MCG, where 28ml fell in 24 hours. In a dirty day for the Hawks, Roughy had an ok game, kicking 2 goals 1 behind and took 6 marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coldest game he played in (the snow game last week in Canberra would’ve won had he played) was in Tasmania - no surprises - against the Lions in that horrible premiership hangover year in 2009. The maximum temperature was a crisp 10.8 degrees and there was even 5.2ml of rain. Roughy had a game to forget, with 7 kicks and only 1 goal. A stinker for the whole club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, the round three matchup in Rough’s first season against Essendon was the hottest game he played in… again the Hawks lost this one in a tight two-point loss. Rough managed to kick two goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-about-chas-brownlow&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What about Chas Brownlow?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not known for his prolific Brownlow vote getting, the big Rough received 59 votes in total, at an average of 0.225 votes per game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughy’s All Australian years in 2013 and 2014 saw his average votes per games peak; he received 0.59 and 0.55 votes per game respectively. Five of his 14 seasons saw zero votes awarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tribute_to_roughy_files/figure-html/votes-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1056&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;who-umpired-the-big-man&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Who umpired the big man?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughy has seen 99 umpires during his time in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brett Rosebury officiated 41 of Roughy’s games, with Matt Nicholls and Matt Stevic following closely behind with 37 times each. Twelve umpires officiated Roughy’s games on at least 20 occasions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 41 games Rosebury officiated, 13 were in finals - by far the most finals games with Roughy than any umpire. Of the umpires with at least 20 games, only Stephen McBurney hasn’t umpired Rough in a final, while Troy Pannell has umpired him once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tribute_to_roughy_files/figure-html/umpires-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1056&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;were-some-kinder-to-rough&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Were some kinder to Rough?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can answer this question looking at Brownlow votes and Free Kick counts… The analysis will limit itself to those 12 umpires who have officiated his games at least 20 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always knew I disliked Razor Ray… now I know why. He and Michael Vozzo were the only umpires on this list to fail to award a Brownlow vote to the big man. Shaun Ryan awarded them at a rate of just over half a vote for the 23 games he officiated Roughy’s games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tribute_to_roughy_files/figure-html/umpVotes-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1056&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did Shaun Ryan award Brownlow votes at a higher rate than any of his brethren on this list, he also didn’t discriminate between how many frees were awarded for and against the big man, though he did award 1.05 frees against, the fifth highest amount on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Vozzo had the largest discrepancy between the number of frees, awarding less than 0.5 frees for Roughy (0.478), while penalising the big Rough at a rate of 1.09 per game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 1.1 frees against per game, the pest Razor and Shane McInerney penalised Rough the most, while Simon Meredith (0.75) penalised him the least (0.84).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troy Pannell awarded Roughy the most frees on average (1.29).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tribute_to_roughy_files/figure-html/frees-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1056&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;finally-bouncing&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Finally, Bouncing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was Roughy a superstar footballer, he was a gun junior basketballer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bouncing is an important piece of the basketball puzzle… I wonder if Rough bounced the ball much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average number of bounces per player per game is 0.529. Throughout Roughy’s career, he bounced the ball at a rate of 0.12 per game… a fair bit off the average…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His rookie season was his best bouncing season at a rate of 0.562 bounces per game.. Clarko must have ironed that out of his game and must have been thrilled in 2009 (other than the premiership hangover) when Roughy didn’t bounce the ball once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/tribute_to_roughy_files/figure-html/bouncing-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1056&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that’s all for this tribute to the great Jarryd Roughead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to watching his last game, and then seeing him around the media hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love ya Rough!&lt;/p&gt;
