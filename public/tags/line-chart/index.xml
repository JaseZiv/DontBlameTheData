      <description>This post aims to introduce you to animating ggplot2 visualisations in r using the gganimate package by Thomas Lin Pedersen.
The post will visualise the theoretical winnings I would’ve had, had I followed the simple model to predict (or tip as it’s known in Australia) winners in the AFL that I explained in this post. The data used in the analysis was collected from the AFL Tables website as part of a larger series I wrote about on AFL crowds.</description>
