      <p>This is a test website created by Jason Zivkovic.</p>

<p>Growing up as a sports-mad child and teen, statistics were always in my world. But with the love of sport blinding me, I didn&rsquo;t even realise it was a love of statistics and data. Then, after meandering (much to my moter&rsquo;s chagrin) through my early work life, and dabbling with things, I discovered edX and the data analysis short courses they had available. I started taking them and my love of the data was rekindled!</p>

<p>This blog will be mainly about sport, but will touch on other parts of life also. What I can promise through is it will be filled with my own selfish pleasures. I hope they align with my readers&rsquo; interests. The one constant is that the data will tell the story. If you don&rsquo;t agree with it, please, please don&rsquo;t blame the data.</p>

<p>The aim of this is to hold some of my works and to share them with the public.</p>
