My name is Jason Zivkovic and I’m a Data Scientist from Melbourne, Australia, working at the Reece Group.

Some of my passions include web scraping, package and app development, statistical modeling, sports analytics and data visualisation.

The bulk of my programming is done using the R programming language, with some Python thrown in.

## What you will find here

This blog will be mainly about R programming, mainly through sports, but will touch on other parts of life also, using data visualisations to tell the story. What I can promise though is it will be filled with my own selfish pleasures. I hope they align with my readers’ interests. 

Some of the sports that will be included include Australian Rules Football (AFL), Basketball, American Football, World Football (Soccer) and many more.

The one constant is that the data will tell the story. 

If you don’t agree with it, please, please don’t blame the data.

Importantly, all views expressed here are my own.
