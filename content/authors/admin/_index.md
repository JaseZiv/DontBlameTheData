My name is Jason Zivkovic and I’m a Data Scientist at the Reece Group.

Growing up as a sports-mad child and teen, statistics were always in my world. But with the love of sport blinding me, I didn’t even realise it was a love of statistics and data. Then, after meandering (much to my mother’s chagrin) through my early work life, and dabbling with different careers, I discovered edX and DataCamp and the programming-focused data analysis short courses they had available. I started taking them and my love of the data was rekindled! Life was made a lot easier in that I had two managers in a row who’s thirst for analytics was as prominent as mine and they gave me the freedom to learn, explore and discover endless possibilities. To them I will be forever greatful.

Kaggle was where I first started dabbling in small analyses - the datasets are as diverse as any wide-eyed newbie could wish for. I still have a look from time to time and think I should write another kernel. I got some great help from the Kaggle community and the code bases there are really good for any new starter. You can find my profile [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jaseziv83).
