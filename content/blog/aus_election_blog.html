<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Australian 2019 Federal Election is almost upon us (18th of May) and as usual, I have no idea who to vote for. Well that’s not true, usually, I’m what is colloquially described as a “donkey voter” - someone who doesn’t vote. You see, in democratic Australia, it is compulsory to vote. From the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Failure to vote at a federal election without a valid and sufficient reason is an offence under section 245 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. You are required to pay the $20 penalty.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence me exercising my democratic right to donkey vote.</p>
<p>It’s not that I don’t care about the state of our great and lucky country (I mean that with all sincerity), rather, it’s that the choice we face is essentially the same, with only the most minor of differences in policies. We’re lucky in that our vote is not a vote between freedom or oppression, so maybe that’s been the driver for my ignorant behaviour?</p>
<p>This year’s vote sees Scott Morrison of the Liberals (the blue, right-leaning party for non-Aussies) taking on Bill Shorten of Labor (the red, left-leaning party). Scott Morrison, referred to as ScoMo, became the Liberal leader after a successful coup against Malcolm Turnbull on August 24th 2018.</p>
<p>This year is different though - not the starkness of the differences between the two major political parties - this year I think I want to make a vote. But to do it, one of the pieces of information I’ll use is which leader’s tweeting activity I like more. This won’t be the only piece of information I base my vote on (I’m not completely mad), but it will be a start.</p>
<p>I started this analysis with a completely blank slate. Furthermore, I didn’t even know what Twitter activity I was going to base my vote on. I just wen’t ahead and collected tweets from both ScoMo and Shorten and took it from there.</p>

<div id="the-methods" class="section level1">
<h1>The methods</h1>
<p>The analysis was created using the statistical programming language R (version 3.4.3) and done in the ide RStudio.</p>
<p>Twitter data was collected on the 3rd of May 2019 using the <code>rtweet</code> package for the two party leaders.</p>
<p>Packages used in the analysis are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rtweet</code>: for tweets</li>
<li><code>ROAuth</code>: for twitter authorisation</li>
<li><code>tidyverse</code>: data munging and visualisations</li>
<li><code>lubridate</code>: working with dates</li>
<li><code>scales</code>: plotting axis in a formatted way</li>
<li><code>zoo</code>: working with yyyy-mm dates</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Analysis</h1>
<p>The analysis looks at tweets the two leaders have been creating since ScoMo took office.</p>
<p>I will ask a number of questions, with the winner of each being awarded a point. Whoever has more points at the end of the analysis will get my vote for the Twitter portion of this decision process.</p>
<p>There is a real limitation in this analysis though - Twitter is only one platform, so taking all social media platforms may have yielded different results. Additionally, the demographic of either party’s constituents may or may not be all that suited to this platform. In saying that, why sweat the small stuff?!</p>
<div id="who-tweets-more" class="section level2">
<h2>Who tweets more?</h2>
<p>Since ScoMo took office, he has tweeted or retweeted 551 time, while in that same time Shorten has tweeted 977 times.</p>
<p>In that same time, Bill Shorten has been tweeting far more frequently in all full months, with only January this year seeing the gap between the two fairly close.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/aus_election_blog_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Additionally, since the beginning of 2018, ScoMo has only tweeted more than Shorten for the month twice, coming in consecutive months in May and June (in his then capacity as Treasurer, no doubt spruiking that year’s budget).</p>

<div id="who-gets-more-favourites" class="section level3">
<h3>Who gets more favourites?</h3>
<p>When measuring tweet popularity by the number of <em>favourites</em> it receives, Shorten takes the chocolates in this measure, with a median of 536 favourites, to ScoMo’s 325.</p>
<p>ScoMo did the get the two highest favourite counts though, with the following tweet getting 15,936 favourite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The remarks by Senator Fraser Anning blaming the murderous attacks by a violent, right-wing, extremist terrorist in New Zealand on immigration are disgusting. Those views have no place in Australia, let alone the Australian Parliament.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who could forget, Senator Anning’s ridiculously insensitive remarks…</p>
</div>
<div id="who-gets-retweeted-more" class="section level3">
<h3>Who gets retweeted more?</h3>
<p>Shorten clearly gets more retweets (median retweet 215.5 to ScoMo’s 61). ScoMo’s tweet above about Senator Anning was also the most retweeted tweet. Shorten’s most retweeted tweet was about ScoMo’s school’s cuts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scott Morrison has locked in massive cuts to public schools.No one voted for Morrison’s cuts to public schools, but he’s cutting them anyway. Please share so everyone knows what just happened.</p>

<h2>Who uses more media (photos, videos)?</h2>
<p>The use of media is interesting when it comes to politicians… who doesn’t love a good opportunity to awkwardly shake a few hands or awkwardly kiss a few babies, while the cameras are around?!</p>
<p>Shorten tends to include photos in more of his tweets than ScoMo, with almost 50% of all of Shorten’s tweets containing a photo. ScoMo isn’t far behind, with 47% of his tweets containing a photo, but he needs to lift his baby kissing game. I’m going to call this a tie. Like in tennis, either candidate needs to win by two or more games (yes I realise this isn’t tennis, I’m choosing political parties based on their tweets so there are no rules here).</p>

<div id="tweet-content-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>Tweet Content Analysis</h1>
<p>Shorten’s most frequently used term in tweets is “Labor”, with the word appearing in over 30% of all of his tweets. Compare this to ScoMo, whose own party doesn’t appear in the list of his 30 most frequently used terms.</p>
<p>Shorten’s tweets appear to talk about the royal commission (the current one into bank lending I assume since banks also appear) with some frequency, while also mentioning the heart-string items - <em>cuts</em>, <em>schools</em>, <em>family</em>, <em>medicare</em>. He also seems to be mentioning his opponent quite frequently.</p>
<p>ScoMo seems to be keeping the content of his tweets focused on the economy, with terms such as <em>economy</em>, <em>jobs</em>, <em>businesses</em>, <em>budget</em> and a few hashtags (<em>strongeraus</em> and <em>buildingyoureconomy</em>) appearing quite frequently.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to measure the sentiment scores of their tweeting behaviour.</p>

<h2>How often does each leader mention their opponent</h2>
<p>Some assumptions needed to be made to determine whether each candidate mentions the oposition in their tweets. If the words “Bill”, “Shorten”, “Labor” or “Opposition” appeared in ScoMo’s tweets, then we say he has mentioned his competitor. On the other hand, if Shorten’s tweets contain any of “Scott”, “Morrisson”, “Liberal”, “Liberals”, then we say that he mentioned his competitor in his tweets.</p>
<p>Shorten’s tweets contain a lot of references to his opponent, with almost one in five of his tweets (19%) making reference to his oppenent, while ScoMo only mentions Shorten in just over 7% of his tweets. I think that raises an interesting question; do we want our leaders focused on the job at hand, or what someone else is doing?</p>

<p>Using this method, it is clear that ScoMo has been using Twitter to push a more positive message than Shorten, with an overall positivity index of 578 compared to Shorten’s 346</p>
<p>When we look at this over time, it’s clear that Shorten has started to tweet with increasing negativity. I wonder if his messaging strategy is to use fear and negativity to get voters to turn out and vote for Labor…</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Of the eight questions posed, ScoMo wins five to Shorten’s two from my perspective. The two candidates drew one question. While Shorten tweets more frequently and uses imagery more often, the content of ScoMo’s tweets get him over the line in my 2019 Federal Twitter election.</p>
</div>
<div id="bonus-content" class="section level1">
<h1>Bonus Content</h1>
<p>Ok, more so because I’m intrigued, the words both leaders use most frequently when either mentioning or not mentioning their opponent in their tweets are below.</p>
<p>Shorten talks about fairness, time, deliver and families when he’s not talking about ScoMo. Ehen he is, it seems to be heavily influenced by the banks and the royal commission, cuts to penalty rates and schools.</p>
<p>ScoMo on the other hand talks about the strength of his government, jobs, the economy, suport and having a plane when not mentioning Shorten, while his most frequent words when Shorten is mentioned are about tax, borders, detention and retirees. As we saw earlier, Shorten or Labor don’t feature too heavily in ScoMo’s tweets.</p>
<p>Feel free to comment if you have any thoughts.</p>
