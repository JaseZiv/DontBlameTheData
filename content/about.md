This is a test website created by Jason Zivkovic.

Growing up as a sports-mad child and teen, statistics were always in my world. But with the love of sport blinding me, I didn't even realise it was a love of statistics and data. Then, after meandering (much to my moter's chagrin) through my early work life, and dabbling with things, I discovered edX and the data analysis short courses they had available. I started taking them and my love of the data was rekindled!

This blog will be mainly about sport, but will touch on other parts of life also. What I can promise through is it will be filled with my own selfish pleasures. I hope they align with my readers' interests. The one constant is that the data will tell the story. If you don't agree with it, please, please don't blame the data.

The aim of this is to hold some of my works and to share them with the public.
