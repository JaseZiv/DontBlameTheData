This project holds all files and code used to create the [Dont Blame the Data](dontblamethedata.com) website.

The site is built using the `blogdown` package.

Data for some of the posts is stored in a separate repository, and can be found [here](https://github.com/JaseZiv/Dont-Blame-the-Data-Data-Files)
